Elixir exception tracking and reporting to SmartBear [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/).

[Tower](https://github.com/mimiquate/tower) reporter for BugSnag.

## Installation

Package can be installed by adding `tower_bugsnag` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tower_bugsnag, "~> 0.4.2"}
  ]
end
```

## Setup

### Option A: Automated setup

```sh
$ mix tower_bugsnag.install
```

### Option B: Manual setup

Register `TowerBugsnag` as a reporter.

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config(
  :tower,
  :reporters,
  [
    # along any other possible reporters
    TowerBugsnag
  ]
)
```

And finally configure `:tower_bugsnag`, with at least it's API key.

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs

if config_env() == :prod do
  config :tower_bugsnag,
    api_key: System.get_env("BUGSNAG_API_KEY"),
    release_stage: System.get_env("DEPLOYMENT_ENV", to_string(config_env()))
end
```

## Reporting

That's it.
There's no extra source code needed to get reports in BugSnag.

Tower will automatically report any errors (exceptions, throws or abnormal exits) occurring in your application.
That includes errors in any plug call (including Phoenix), Oban jobs, async task or any other Elixir process.

### Manual reporting

You can manually report errors just by informing `Tower` about any manually caught exceptions, throws or abnormal exits.

```elixir
try do
  # possibly crashing code
rescue
  exception ->
    Tower.report_exception(exception, __STACKTRACE__)
end
```
